Do you have thousands of unidentified songs, all named consecutively Track 1 <br> This application will help you to finally identify those songs with a simple drag and drop.

## Description
Shazam is an app that lets you identify music. Leveraging what this already does well, create a media player that would identify songs and rename them accordingly. Wouldn't it be nice if there was a desktop media player that, when loaded an unidentified song, would immediately tell what it is and then rename the song and the file? There are some APIs that are available to do the task of identifying songs. In fact the service found is also used by YouTube to identify songs in videos. 

Rebuttal: iTunes can identify tracks from CDs already. This is true. But can it identify songs that were ripped directly off of an iPod? "MFDZ.mp3" isn't very useful. But if an application could identify hundreds of these;   THAT would be useful.

### TLDR 
Shazam but for your desktop and it renames files
